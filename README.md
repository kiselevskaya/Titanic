# Titanic

https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. 
Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

Given two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.
One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.

The goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” (predict whether the 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived).
